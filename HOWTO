Handy git commands
------------------

1. stage a change to F
git commit F [-m "message"]

2. stage all modified & deleted files, but not new files
git commit -a [-m "message"]

3. push changes to the master repo
git push

4. add a new file N
git add N
git commit

LaTeX stuff
-----------

The LaTeX source files in this repository rely on some style files
that are not present and not part of the standard texlive
distribution.

In order to use them you need to run the command

  git clone https://github.com/gdg8/csstyles.git

in a directory where LaTeX will find them.

On a Mac a good place is in ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex

On Linux it's ~/texmf/tex/latex

Some additional style files are needed before the makefile will run successfully. 
These are collated for you in the texmf folder, just copy this to your home directory and it should work.

You also need an up to date version of texlive (we have used the 2013 distribution)

Note: If you are using TexLive 2014, you may need to remove or rename the file
mdframed.sty in the csstyles directory, as a newer version is available as part
of the TexLive distribution.

Making the PGT version (Toby, 03/09/17)
----------------------

The PGT version is made from a subset of the UG files --
intro{0,2,4}.tex -- together with some conditional commands in the
.tex to avoid some UG-specific bits:

\begin{firstonly}
stuff to appear in UG version only
\end{firstonly}

\begin{pgtonly}
stuff to appear in PGT version only
\end{pgtonly}

and

\firstorpgt{UG text}{PGT text}

intro-body-pgt.tex needs editing
per year to set the date. Otherwise to build the PGT doc type
 
  make pgt

and pgt-intro.pdf is made.

Copying files to the Web (toby 030918)
--------------------------------------

The PDFs are visible at:

syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/2018/COMP10120/labscripts/

index.html doesn't need changing if the filenames don't change.

To put files here, use the "publish" script, which copies *pdf to

  babbage:/www/virtualHosts/studentnet/ugt/2018/COMP10120/labscripts

$ ./publish
